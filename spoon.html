<p class="spoon"> The spoon might seem inferior to the fork but is actually used daily to consume many types of dishes. Often seen at breakfast time, the spoon is most useful for eating cereal, yogurt, oatmeal, and even eggs. The spoon also comes in handy when stirring cream, sugar, honey or milk into ones morning beverage. Spoons are also helpful for young childeren, as it is often easier to make a scooping action rather than skewering for small uncoordinated hands. Although, it is very difficult to eat long pasta with a spoon because there is nothing to catch the food from slipping back down to the plate.</p>

<p class="knife">Knives are incredibly important to include in the roster of popular food utensils. There are several instances when one wishes to saw through their food with a ribbed, sharp, metallic edge. Sometimes people enjoy the satisfaction of "working" to cut through their food with a knife, in order to create a bite sized piece. Knives are also particularly helpful for sawing pieces of vegetables, meat and other foods, so a perfect bite might be created and skewered onto a fork. To paint a picture, one might saw through a baked sweet potato with their knife, while holding the potato secured to the plate. Then smoothly cut through a piece of avocado, scooping some black beans with it, and finally using the knife, mounting all three foods onto the fork to create a delicious and balanced morsel.</p>

<p class="knife">(Important note: notice how the plural spelling of knife changes to knives, this is not common in words for food utensils)</p>

  <p>My background in design includes a physical practice around furniture, pattern making, clothing and object design. In 2020 I started making clothes, lamps and other objects, which I have been selling from my small busniness, under the name ISOBEL (after the Bjork song). Here is a link to my website, which I made using Adobe Portfolio last year:</p>

  <p>Additionally, my practice includes collaborative projects with other artists. This October, I released an arts and culture publication, with a close friend and photographer, called SUKO Magazine. During the production of this first issue, we worked on graphics in InDesign, and communicated and collabrated with artists based in Montreal and Toronto, my hometown. The process thaught us some of the ins and outs of working with the printshop, Graphiscan, and facilitating positive relationships with creative parteners. You can find our mag at:</p>

  <p>Through these kinds of community based projects, I hope to create uplifting and mindful spaces for like-minded creatives. I am also heavily interested in Buddhist and Canadian Indigenous philosophies, which influences the themes of my work. For my final project in this course, I am planning to create a narrative site, based on meditation and the practice of mindfulness in everyday life.</p>

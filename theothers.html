<p>The dessert fork is used for any sort of dessert which requires a cutting, scooping, and/or spearing action. Most reliable in a cake or pie situation, the dessert fork allows for a smaller - more decadent - bite than a regular sized fork. It is important that a smaller fork be used to consume a dessert, as the dishes are likely meant to be savoured and thuroughly enjoyed, with patience and mindfullness. The dessert fork can also be an opprotunity to add a decorative touch to a dining arrangement. Often people will purchase a full "dinner set" minus dessert utensils, later collecting vintage or antique finds. A stylish or unique dessert fork can change the entire experience of eating dessert. But beware, when attempting to scoop an ice cream or pudding type dessert one finds that the food slips through the prongs of the dessert fork before the tasty morsel reaches the lips</p>

<p class="theothers">Another outlier of standard Western utensils is the soup spoon. Not every meal comes with soup - or dessert for that matter - therefor these less popular utensils are somewhat unfamiliar for some. Because of the larger head, a soup spoon is actually quite necessary in the case that there is soup in the meal. If a household does not own a set of soup spoons however, this is not an extreme failure. Soup can easily still be enjoyed with a regular sized spoon, perhaps a ceral spoon, or sipped striaght from a bowl or mug.</p>


<p class="theothers"> This website neglects to include information about the rest of the untensils, and the list really does go on. More and more, tools like chopsticks are becoming staples in mainstream Western domestic cooking preparation and consumption. Although there are several others, these are the key untensils which many use daily.</p>

  <p>Design:</p>
  <p>The sense of design on this site appears very well throughout. It has a seamless quality, which is pleasing to look at. The general aesthetics of this artist are very visible.</p>
  <p>Usability:</p>
  <p>When you first click the URL, is it a bit confusing what to do next. You aren't easily directed through to the home page. This makes it harder to use, but is also quite playful and fun for a younger audience perhaps.</p>
  <p>Content:</p>
  <p>The content is fairly clear, as you click on an image you learn a bit about each project. Although there is nowhere to find more in-depth information on each project. It makes it feel like there is a lack of information presented. There is also minimal/no information on the "about" page.</p>
  <p>Creativity:</p>
  <p>This is a really creative and unique idea for an artist's portfolio website. It isn't what one expects to find, as there is a seemingly never ending scroll of projects (which are very up to date) and their method of presentation is exciting. You never know what will come next!</p>

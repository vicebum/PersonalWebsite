<p class="fork">Forks are often used in tandem with a knife, but they also work well on their own. Many people like to use both a knife and a fork at the same time, but really, most forks are capable of cutting through foods by using the sharp sides to slice downward. Forks are used to eat very many foods, from salad, to noodles, to rice, and more! Forks are quite pointy on their heads, so it is good to take precaution and eat meals without haste (this is also good for digestion). Forks are a very intuitive food untensil and seem to not require very much explaination.</p>

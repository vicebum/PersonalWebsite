    <p>Design:</p>
    <p>The logo of this company is very striking and catches the eye when you first enter the site. Something that doesn't work as well is that the colour pallet and pattern design, on the right side of the home page especially, clashes with the rest of the content style. The design feels a bit incongruent and choppy throughout the site.</p>
    <p>Usability:</p>
    <p>The menu is hidden and only appears when you click on the logo, making it difficult to find what you're looking for. The scroll on the main page is also a bit off feeling, not giving the viewer much information.</p>
    <p>Content:</p>
    <p>Once you locate the menu, there is a good amount of information in each part of the directory. There are good descriptions, not too long, for each heading. As well, it is easy to locate important information about the company.</p>
    <p>Creativity:</p>
    <p>Because the website is pretty hard to use, it forces you to explore it in a way which actually works well. You are surprised by each click you make and inspired by each new graphic element. The illustrative quality to the design is unique and fun for the user, especially based on their clienteles' interests.</p>

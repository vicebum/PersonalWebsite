    <p>Design:</p>
    <p>The grid works really well for this website, as it keeps everything clean and orgnaized. Even though the colour is pretty dull, it acts as a nice backdrop for all of the colourful and busy designs of the artist's portfolio.</p>
    <p>Usability:</p>
    <p>To navigate this website, you click on each underlined piece of text (which doesn't change, but becomes highlighted depending on the page). I find this helpful because the "menu" is totally static the entire time.</p>
    <p>Content:</p>
    <p>There is a lot of content displayed at once. It might be helpful if there were fewer projects displayed per line, within the grid. THey could also cut down on the amount of projects displayed.</p>
    <p>Creativity:</p>
    <p>This website works really well for the artist's style of work. In its layout and style guide, the website is not very interesting or dynamic for an unfamiliar user.</p>
